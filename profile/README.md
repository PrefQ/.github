PrefQ, the cloud-native priority queue implementation designed specifically for Microsoft Azure, fills a critical gap in the cloud ecosystem by offering native support for priority queues. In a landscape where prioritizing messages or events is essential, PrefQ stands out as a highly available, low-latency, and versatile solution, enabling organizations to efficiently manage tasks and resources based on their relative importance.

## Features:

1. **Native Support for Priority Queues:**
   - PrefQ introduces native support for priority queues in Azure, empowering users to efficiently manage and process messages or events based on their priority levels.

2. **Cloud-Native Design:**
   - Built from the ground up to be cloud-native, PrefQ seamlessly integrates with Azure's robust cloud infrastructure, harnessing its scalability and elasticity.

3. **Highly Available and Low Latency:**
   - PrefQ ensures high availability and low-latency processing, making it ideal for real-time and latency-sensitive workloads.

4. **Customizable Non-Discrete Priorities:**
   - PrefQ's innovative approach supports non-discrete weights as priorities, offering fine-grained control over task execution order and accommodating dynamic priority criteria.

5. **Strict Highest-Priority-First Consumption:**
   - PrefQ adheres to a strict highest-priority-first consumption model, ensuring that critical tasks are always processed first.

6. **Efficient Resource Allocation:**
   - PrefQ prevents resource waste by efficiently managing messages, especially those within SLAs, optimizing resource utilization and system performance.

7. **Real-Time Monitoring and Analytics:**
   - PrefQ *aims to integrates seamlessly with Azure's monitoring and analytics tools*, providing real-time insights into its performance and enabling users to make data-driven optimizations.

8. **Streamlined Cloud Service Integration:**
   - PrefQ *aims to effortlessly integrates with various Azure services*, including serverless functions, containers, databases, and message brokers, facilitating the orchestration of complex workflows and applications.


## Problem Statement

Currently, Azure's native message and event queue services lack built-in support for priority queues. Existing implementations are often dependent on the number of consumers per queue and require predefined, discrete values for message priorities. This presents several challenges:

1. **Lack of Native Priority Queue Support:** Azure's queue services, while robust, do not natively support priority queues, limiting the ability to efficiently process messages in order of importance.

2. **Dependency on Consumer Count:** Many Azure implementations of priority queues rely on the number of consumers per queue, which can be inflexible and challenging to scale.

3. **Predefined and Discrete Priorities:** Implementing priority queues in Azure often mandates pre-decided priorities based on discrete values, which may not accommodate dynamic business needs.

4. **Inefficient Resource Utilization:** Messages still in their Service Level Agreements (SLAs) can continue consuming resources which could be allocated to messages nearing out of SLA, leading to suboptimal resource allocation.
